## Run a Node

The Turbo client node is a lightweight process that runs in the background and that lets you earn passive crypto rewards for sharing your unused Internet bandwidth.

#### Compatibility

| Platform | Supported |
|----------|-----------|
| Windows  | ✅         |
| Linux    | ✅         |
| macOS    | ✅         |
| Mobile   | ❌         |

#### Installation

- Download the [latest release](https://github.com/L1shed/Turbo/releases) for your platform.
- Open the downloaded executable — a new icon will appear in your system tray.
- Click on the icon and select **"Connect"** to pair with your account.

- A page will open, if authentication is successful, you will be redirected to the dashboard and your new node will appear in the nodes list.

  You can add an unlimited amount of nodes as long as they are on different networks/IPs.

Congratulations, your node is now earning passively, check out your dashboard regularly!

### Monetization

Base reward is `$0.10` per GB shared but bonuses apply such as if:
* Your node has reached a daily connections streak over several days.
* Your node has a stable _long-term_ connection.

`$0.10` may seem low but the network is small, therefore the handled bandwidth per node is high.

For example, a low-end node shares 0.05 GB/hour of bandwidth.
At the current price rate we get $3.72/month + bonuses **per node** if running 24/7, user can run multiple nodes.

#### Score calculation

Your node score is based on two factors:
- $L$: Latency, capped on a range from 10ms to 500ms
- $R$: Reliability

$$
S = w_L \cdot L + w_R \cdot R
$$

Where $w_L =$ 60% , $w_R =$ 40%

### Self-host a Server Node

You're free to operate your own server for commercial use according to the [Apache 2.0 license](LICENSE).

Run server docker image with `docker-compose up` and connect client nodes.

For more information, see [Setting Up Development Environment](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#setting-up-development-environment)


## System Design

See [Global Architecture](#global-architecture) for a high-level overview of the system.

### Traffic flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant SOCKS5_Client as User
    participant Proxy_Server as Server
    participant Proxy_Client as Node
    participant Internet as Internet

    SOCKS5_Client->>Proxy_Server: 1. SOCKS5/HTTP CONNECT request
    Proxy_Server->>Proxy_Client: 2. Forward dest. IP + TLS-encrypted payload via QUIC 
    Proxy_Client->>Internet: 3. Process request (TCP level) as 
    
    Internet-->>Proxy_Client: 4. Return encrypted response
    Proxy_Client-->>Proxy_Server: 5. Send data via QUIC
    Proxy_Server-->>SOCKS5_Client: 6. Send back to SOCKS5 Client
```

## Data Privacy

We log anonymous data for each SOCKS5 connection to train AI models to detect abnormal and malicious traffic.
